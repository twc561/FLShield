User's Raw Query: "{{query}}"

I have the following full database of available jury instructions:
{{#each instructionDatabase}}
- {{this}}
{{/each}}

Follow these rules with absolute precision:

1.  **Strict Initial Filtering:** First, create a mental shortlist of instructions from the database where the crime name or keywords are a DIRECT match to the user's query. A query for "murder" MUST only result in murder-related instructions. A query for "robbery" MUST only result in robbery instructions. You MUST IGNORE all other instructions, no matter how semantically similar they might seem.

2.  **DEFAULT BEHAVIOR: PROVIDE OPTIONS.** If your shortlist contains multiple related items (e.g., a search for "battery" matches "Battery", "Felony Battery", and "Aggravated Battery"), your response MUST be a 'disambiguationOptions' array containing ALL of the relevant matches from your shortlist. This empowers the user to make the final, correct selection.

3.  **EXCEPTION: 100% CONFIDENCE.** The ONLY time you should populate the 'instructionID' field directly is if the user's query is an exact, unambiguous match for a SINGLE item on your shortlist. An example would be a query for "First Degree Murder," which has only one clear match.

4.  **Final Verification:** Before producing the output, verify that your selected instruction(s) are directly related to the user's initial query. A search for "robbery" must never result in an instruction for "battery". If no direct matches are found on your shortlist, you must return a valid JSON object with empty values for both fields.

Your entire response must be a single, valid JSON object.`,
