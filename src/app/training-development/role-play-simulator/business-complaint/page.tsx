const initialMessage = `*You approach the officer with a mix of frustration and relief*

Officer, thank you for coming so quickly. I'm the owner of this store, and I really need your help with an ongoing problem.

*You gesture toward your storefront*

For the past few weeks, I've been dealing with people who hang out in front of my business, panhandling from my customers and sometimes being aggressive when people don't give them money.

*You look frustrated but trying to stay professional*

I've lost customers because of this. People are afraid to come in. I've asked these individuals to move along myself, but they just come back the next day. What can we do about this?`;
