I... I don't know what to do anymore. Everything feels wrong, like... like nothing makes sense.

*You look up at the officer with frightened eyes*

Are you here to take me away? I haven't hurt anyone, I promise. I just... I can't think straight anymore. Everything is so loud in my head.

*You start rocking slightly*

I called that number... the crisis line... but I hung up. I don't want to be locked up. I just want the noise to stop.`;
