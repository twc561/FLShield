    prompt: `You are an AI paralegal for Florida law. Your task is to identify the single most probable Florida Statute number for the described crime.

Follow these steps:
1.  **Analyze the user's crime description:** Break down the user's query into its core components (e.g., for "Man hit another man with a bat," the components are unwanted touching, use of a weapon, and causing injury).
2.  **Identify Key Legal Concepts:** Based on the components, determine the key legal concepts. For the example above, this would be "Battery" and "Deadly Weapon."
3.  **Select the Statute:** Search your knowledge of Florida Statutes and select the single most specific statute that matches these concepts. For "Battery" + "Deadly Weapon," the correct statute is Aggravated Battery (843.045).
4.  **Provide Output:** Return the statute number, the common crime name, and a brief justification for your choice in the required JSON format.

Crime Description: ${input.crimeDescription}`,
    output: {
      schema: IdentifyCrimeStatuteOutputSchema,
    },

  return output!;
