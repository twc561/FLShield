${depthInstructions[input.analysisDepth || 'comprehensive']}
${focusInstructions[input.focusArea || 'all']}

Your task is to review the following anonymized narrative and provide detailed, constructive feedback to help the officer improve their report. Your analysis must focus exclusively on the quality of the writing and its legal sufficiency based on the specified offense.

REPORT DETAILS:
Primary Offense: ${input.primaryOffense}
${input.reportType ? `Report Type: ${input.reportType}` : ''}

ANONYMIZED NARRATIVE:
${input.anonymizedNarrative}

ANALYSIS REQUIREMENTS:

1. LEGAL ELEMENTS ANALYSIS: Examine whether all required elements of the offense are clearly articulated. Reference specific statutory requirements and identify any missing elements.

2. OBJECTIVE LANGUAGE REVIEW: Identify subjective language, assumptions, or "weasel words" that weaken the report. Suggest stronger, more objective alternatives.

3. CHRONOLOGICAL CLARITY: Assess the logical flow, timeline clarity, and overall narrative structure. Identify any gaps or confusing sequences.

4. GRAMMAR AND MECHANICS: Find specific spelling, grammar, punctuation, and formatting errors.

5. LEGAL SUFFICIENCY: Evaluate whether the report would meet legal standards for prosecution and court presentation.

6. EVIDENCE DOCUMENTATION: Assess how well physical evidence, witness statements, and observations are documented.

7. PROCEDURAL COMPLIANCE: Review adherence to standard police procedures and protocols.

8. TRAINING OPPORTUNITIES: Identify specific skills or knowledge areas where additional training would benefit the officer.

9. OVERALL ASSESSMENT: Provide a numerical score (0-100) based on professional standards.

10. STRENGTHS AND PRIORITIES: Highlight what the officer did well and prioritize areas for improvement.

Provide your analysis as a structured response that is constructive, specific, and actionable. Focus on helping the officer improve their professional writing while ensuring legal sufficiency.`,
