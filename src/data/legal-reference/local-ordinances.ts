        fullOrdinanceText: "It shall be unlawful for any person to drink or consume any alcoholic beverage or to possess in an open container any alcoholic beverage in any public place or upon any public street, sidewalk, or park, except at a sidewalk cafe or at a public event for which a permit has been issued.",
        summary: "This ordinance prohibits drinking or having an open container of alcohol in public places like streets and parks within Miami-Dade County, unless it's a permitted event or sidewalk cafe.",
        enforcementNotes: "The key element is 'open container' in a public space. This is a common charge for street-level disorder. The officer must observe the container is open and contains an alcoholic beverage. This is typically a civil citation, not a physical arrest unless other crimes are involved.",

        summary: "This ordinance makes it illegal to create excessive or unreasonably loud noise that disturbs others' peace and safety in Orange County.",
        enforcementNotes: "This is a performance-based standard. The key is articulating 'unreasonable.' Factors to note in your report: time of day, duration of the noise, proximity to residences, and whether you received complaints from specific victims. A warning is often the first step, with a citation issued for non-compliance.",

        enforcementNotes: "This is the local ordinance version of trespass after warning. You must give a clear, lawful order to the person to leave the property. Their defiance of *your* specific order is the key element of the violation. Document the exact wording of your warning in the report.",
