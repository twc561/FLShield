(If breath test is impractical or refused, or drugs are suspected): I am now requesting that you submit to a lawful test of your urine for the purpose of determining the presence of any chemical or controlled substance.

Should you refuse to submit to the breath or urine test I have requested of you, your privilege to operate a motor vehicle will be suspended for a period of one year for a first refusal, or a period of 18 months if your privilege has been previously suspended for a prior refusal.

Additionally, if you refuse to submit to the test I have requested, and your driving privilege has been previously suspended for a prior refusal to submit to a lawful test of your breath, urine, or blood, you will be committing a misdemeanor of the first degree.

Do you wish to submit to this test?`
