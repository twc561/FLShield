    details: [
      "There is reason to believe the person is mentally ill.",
      "The person has refused voluntary examination OR is unable to determine that examination is necessary.",
      "Without care or treatment, the person is likely to suffer from neglect or refuse to care for themselves, posing a real and present threat of substantial harm.",
      "There is a substantial likelihood that without care or treatment the person will cause serious bodily harm to themselves or others in the near future, as evidenced by recent behavior.",
    ],
    officerTakeaway: "You must articulate specific, recent behaviors in your report. Vague statements like 'acting erratically' are not enough. Document direct quotes, specific actions, and observations that support one of the criteria above. The 'likelihood of serious harm' is the key legal threshold.",

      "The person is likely to inflict physical harm on themselves or others unless admitted, OR their judgment is so impaired that they are incapable of appreciating their need for care.",
    ],
    officerTakeaway: "Similar to the Baker Act, but the root cause must be substance abuse, not mental illness. Often, these co-occur. Your report needs to detail evidence of substance use (paraphernalia, admissions, track marks) and how it's leading to self-neglect or dangerous behavior.",

      "Lower your voice and slow your speech. Maintain a calm, non-threatening posture.",
