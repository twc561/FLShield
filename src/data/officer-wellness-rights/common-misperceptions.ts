    theReality: "This is no longer true in Florida. Due to the legalization of medical marijuana and hemp (which is visually and olfactorily identical to illegal cannabis), the smell of marijuana alone is not enough to establish probable cause for a search. An officer must now articulate 'plus factors'â€”additional evidence that suggests the marijuana is being used or possessed illegally.",

    theReality: "A 'frisk' is strictly a limited pat-down of the outer clothing for weapons only. It is not a search for evidence. To justify a frisk, you need separate reasonable suspicion that the person is armed and dangerous. If you feel an object during the frisk whose identity as contraband is 'immediately apparent' without manipulation, you may seize it under the 'Plain Feel' doctrine. This is a very high standard to meet.",

    theReality: "This tactic, known as 'threat of warrant,' can invalidate an otherwise voluntary consent. For consent to be valid, it must be freely and voluntarily given, not the result of coercion or duress. Telling someone you will get a warrant can be seen as coercive, implying they have no real choice. The court will examine the totality of the circumstances to determine if the consent was truly voluntary.",

Now, you can only search the passenger compartment if it is reasonable to believe the unsecured arrestee could access the vehicle at the time of the search (officer safety) OR if it's reasonable to believe that evidence relevant to the crime of arrest might be found in the vehicle.",

    theReality: "Legally, this is correct. Under Davis v. United States, the request for counsel must be unambiguous, and police are not required to stop questioning for an equivocal statement. However, this is a major legal pitfall. Continuing to question after an ambiguous statement is a common reason confessions get suppressed.",

    theReality: "The 'Public Safety Exception' is extremely narrow. It only applies to questions necessary to neutralize an immediate and specific public danger, most often a hidden weapon. The exception allows you to ask questions like 'Where is the gun?' before reading Miranda, but it does NOT apply to general, investigatory questions about the crime itself.",

    theReality: "This is a myth based on a misinterpretation of the 'Tueller Drill.' The drill is a training concept to illustrate reaction time, demonstrating how quickly a person with an edged weapon can cover 21 feet. It is NOT a legal rule or justification for the use of force. All use of force, including deadly force, is judged by the 'objective reasonableness' standard from Graham v. Connor, based on the totality of the circumstances at that exact moment.",
