    title: 'Assault',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Defines the crime of assault as an intentional, unlawful threat by word or act to do violence to the person of another, coupled with an apparent ability to do so, and doing some act which creates a well-founded fear in such other person that such violence is imminent.',
    fullText: 'An “assault” is an intentional, unlawful threat by word or act to do violence to the person of another, coupled with an apparent ability to do so, and doing some act which creates a well-founded fear in such other person that such violence is imminent.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Second-degree Misdemeanor',
    practicalSummary: "This is a 'threat' crime; no physical contact is required. Your investigation must establish that the suspect's threat was intentional, that they had the ability to carry it out, and that their actions caused a reasonable fear in the victim. The victim's perception is key—did they actually feel that violence was about to happen?",
    example: "A suspect raises their fist, takes an aggressive step towards a victim, and screams 'I'm going to knock you out!' Even though no punch is thrown, the combination of the words, the action (raised fist, step forward), and the victim's resulting fear completes the elements of an assault.",

    title: 'Aggravated Assault',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Elevates a simple assault to a felony. Occurs when a person commits an assault with a deadly weapon without an intent to kill, or with an intent to commit a felony.',
    fullText: 'An “aggravated assault” is an assault: (a) With a deadly weapon without intent to kill; or (b) With an intent to commit a felony.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Third-degree Felony',
    practicalSummary: "The key difference from simple assault is the presence of a 'deadly weapon' or the intent to commit another felony. A 'deadly weapon' is anything likely to produce death or great bodily harm. Your report must clearly describe the weapon and how it was used to threaten the victim.",
    enhancements: ["Upgrades to a higher felony level if committed against a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or EMS provider under F.S. § 784.07.", "Committing the offense in furtherance of a riot or aggravated riot also enhances the penalty under F.S. § 870.01."],
    example: "A suspect pulls out a knife during an argument and points it at the victim, saying 'I'll cut you.' This is Aggravated Assault because the knife is a deadly weapon used to create fear of imminent violence, elevating it from a misdemeanor to a felony.",

    title: 'Battery',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Defines the crime of battery as actually and intentionally touching or striking another person against their will, or intentionally causing bodily harm to another person.',
    fullText: 'The offense of battery occurs when a person: 1. Actually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; or 2. Intentionally causes bodily harm to another person.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'First-degree Misdemeanor',
    practicalSummary: "This is unwanted physical contact. Unlike assault, battery requires touching. It can be as minor as an unwanted poke or as serious as a punch, as long as it's intentional and against the victim's will. Documenting any visible injuries or lack thereof is important, as is the victim's statement that the contact was unwanted.",
    enhancements: ["Becomes a first-degree felony (Aggravated Battery) if a deadly weapon is used.", "Becomes a third-degree felony (Felony Battery) if it causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.", "Becomes a felony if the victim is a law enforcement officer, firefighter, or other specified personnel under F.S. § 784.07.", "Elevated to a felony if the victim is pregnant and the offender knew or should have known.", "Penalty is enhanced if the offender has a prior battery conviction."],
    example: "During a heated argument, one person intentionally shoves another. The shove is an intentional, unwanted touching, which constitutes a battery. The severity of injury is not required, only the intentional, unwanted contact.",

    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Elevates a simple battery to a felony. Occurs when a person actually and intentionally strikes another person against their will and, in doing so, causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.',
    fullText: 'A person commits felony battery if he or she: (a) Actually and intentionally touches or strikes another person against the will of the other; and (b) Causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Third-degree Felony',
    practicalSummary: "The distinction between misdemeanor battery and felony battery is the level of injury. Your investigation must focus on documenting 'great bodily harm.' This means photographing injuries, getting medical records if possible, and using specific descriptions in your report (e.g., 'deep laceration requiring stitches,' 'broken bone,' 'unconscious') rather than just 'injured.'",
    example: "A suspect punches a victim once, causing the victim to fall and break their arm. Because the battery resulted in 'great bodily harm' (a broken bone), the charge is elevated from a simple misdemeanor battery to a felony battery.",
    url: 'https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.041.html'

    code: 'F.S. § 784.045',
    title: 'Aggravated Battery',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'A more serious form of battery. It occurs when a person, in committing a battery, intentionally or knowingly causes great bodily harm, uses a deadly weapon, or commits a battery on a victim who was pregnant at the time.',
    fullText: 'A person commits aggravated battery who, in committing battery: (a) Intentionally or knowingly causes great bodily harm, permanent disability, or permanent disfigurement; or (b) Uses a deadly weapon. A person also commits aggravated battery if the person who was the victim of the battery was pregnant at the time of the offense and the offender knew or should have known that the victim was pregnant.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Second-degree Felony',
    practicalSummary: "Aggravated Battery is a step above Felony Battery. It can be charged in two main ways: 1) The battery was committed with a deadly weapon (e.g., hitting someone with a baseball bat), or 2) The suspect *intended* to cause the severe injury, not just that a severe injury was the result. The third way is if the victim is known to be pregnant. Your investigation should focus on intent and the use of weapons.",
    example: "A suspect attacks a victim with a beer bottle, striking them in the head. Using the bottle as a weapon to commit the battery constitutes Aggravated Battery, regardless of the severity of the injury, because a 'deadly weapon' was used.",
    url: 'https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.045.html'

    code: 'F.S. § 784.07',
    title: 'Assault or Battery of LEO, etc.',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Enhances the penalties for assault, aggravated assault, battery, and aggravated battery when the victim is a law enforcement officer, firefighter, emergency medical care provider, or other specified public servant engaged in the lawful performance of their duties.',
    fullText: 'Whenever any person is charged with committing an assault or battery upon a law enforcement officer...while the officer...is engaged in the lawful performance of his or her duties, the offense for which the person is charged shall be reclassified to a higher degree.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Reclassification/Enhancement',
    practicalSummary: "This is a penalty-enhancement statute, not a standalone crime. If you are assaulted or battered while on duty, the suspect is charged with the underlying crime (e.g., Battery) and this statute is applied to make the charge more severe. Your report must clearly state that you were in uniform, on duty, and performing a lawful function when the offense occurred.",
    example: "During an arrest, a suspect pushes you. The push is a Battery under 784.03. Because you are an on-duty officer, the charge is enhanced by 784.07, making it a felony instead of a misdemeanor.",

    code: 'F.S. § 782.04',
    title: 'Murder',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: "Defines the unlawful killing of a human being and establishes the distinct elements for different degrees of murder. It notably defines first-degree murder as a killing perpetrated with a 'premeditated design' or one committed during the course of another dangerous felony (felony murder).",
    fullText: 'The unlawful killing of a human being: (1)(a) When perpetrated from a premeditated design to effect the death of the person killed or any human being; (b) When committed by a person engaged in the perpetration of, or in the attempt to perpetrate, any specified felony... constitutes murder in the a.first degree.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'First-degree or Capital Felony',
    practicalSummary: "For homicide investigators, this statute directs your focus. For first-degree murder, your investigation must uncover evidence showing the suspect planned or deliberated the killing beforehand. This includes evidence of motive, acquiring a weapon, lying in wait, or making prior threats. For felony murder, you must prove the death occurred during another serious crime like robbery or kidnapping.",
    example: "A suspect breaks into a home to commit a burglary. The homeowner confronts them, and in the ensuing struggle, the homeowner is killed. Even if the suspect didn't specifically intend to kill, because the death occurred during the commission of a felony (burglary), the State can pursue a first-degree murder charge under the felony murder rule of this statute.",

    code: 'F.S. § 784.048',
    title: 'Stalking',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Defines stalking as willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly following, harassing, or cyberstalking another person.',
    fullText: 'Any person who willfully, maliciously, and repeatedly follows, harasses, or cyberstalks another person commits the offense of stalking.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'First-degree Misdemeanor',
    practicalSummary: 'Stalking requires a pattern of conduct. A single incident is not enough. "Harass" means a course of conduct directed at a specific person which causes substantial emotional distress and serves no legitimate purpose. Cyberstalking involves this pattern using electronic means. Aggravated Stalking is a felony and occurs when the suspect makes a credible threat, violates an injunction, or stalks a minor under 16.',
    example: 'A person repeatedly drives past their ex-partner\'s house, sends them dozens of unwanted text messages daily, and shows up at their workplace uninvited, causing the victim to fear for their safety. This pattern constitutes stalking.',
    url: 'https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0700-0799/0784/Sections/0784.048.html'

    code: 'F.S. § 787.01',
    title: 'Kidnapping',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Defines kidnapping as forcibly, secretly, or by threat confining, abducting, or imprisoning another person against their will and without lawful authority.',
    fullText: 'The term “kidnapping” means forcibly, secretly, or by threat confining, abducting, or imprisoning another person against her or his will and without lawful authority, with intent to: (a) Hold for ransom or reward or as a shield or hostage. (b) Commit or facilitate commission of any felony. (c) Inflict bodily harm upon or to terrorize the victim or another person. (d) Interfere with the performance of any governmental or political function.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'First-degree Felony',
    practicalSummary: 'Kidnapping is the intentional and unlawful confinement of a person against their will by force or threat. The movement of the victim is not necessarily required if they are confined. The charge is often enhanced if it is done to facilitate another felony, like a robbery or sexual battery.',
    example: 'A suspect grabs a victim in a parking lot, forces them into a car at gunpoint, and drives away. This is a clear case of kidnapping.',

    code: 'F.S. § 741.28',
    title: 'Domestic Violence Definition',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Defines "domestic violence" as any assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, stalking, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death of one family or household member by another family or household member.',
    fullText: '“Domestic violence” means any assault, aggravated assault, battery, aggravated battery, sexual assault, sexual battery, stalking, aggravated stalking, kidnapping, false imprisonment, or any criminal offense resulting in physical injury or death of one family or household member by another family or household member.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Definitional',
    practicalSummary: "This is a definitional statute, not a chargeable crime itself. It establishes what relationships qualify for a 'domestic' designation on a crime report (e.g., Battery -> Domestic Battery). 'Family or household members' are spouses, former spouses, persons related by blood or marriage, persons living together as if a family, and parents of a child in common.",
    example: "A boyfriend and girlfriend who live together get into a physical fight where he pushes her. The crime is Battery, and this statute allows it to be classified as Domestic Violence because they are 'family or household members'.",

    code: 'F.S. § 787.02',
    title: 'False Imprisonment',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Defines false imprisonment as forcibly, by threat, or secretly confining, abducting, imprisoning, or restraining another person without lawful authority and against his or her will.',
    fullText: 'The term “false imprisonment” means forcibly, by threat, or secretly confining, abducting, imprisoning, or restraining another person without lawful authority and against her or his will.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Third-degree Felony',
    practicalSummary: "This is a lesser included offense of kidnapping. The main difference is that false imprisonment does not require the intent to commit another felony. It is simply the unlawful confinement of a person. This can occur in domestic disputes where one partner refuses to let the other leave a room or the house.",
    example: 'During an argument, a man stands in a doorway, blocking his girlfriend from leaving the bedroom for an hour despite her repeated requests to leave. This act of confining her against her will constitutes false imprisonment.',

    title: 'Child Abuse',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Makes it illegal to intentionally inflict physical or mental injury upon a child, or commit an act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child.',
    fullText: '“Abuse of a child” means a willful act that a reasonable person would know is likely to result in physical or mental injury to a child or the willful encouragement of any person to commit an act that results or could reasonably be expected to result in physical or mental injury to a child.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (Felony)',
    practicalSummary: 'This statute covers both direct abuse and neglect. Aggravated Child Abuse involves great bodily harm, torture, or malicious punishment and is a first-degree felony. Child Neglect involves a failure to provide necessary care or supervision, resulting in risk to the child. All law enforcement officers are mandatory reporters for suspected child abuse.',
    example: 'A parent repeatedly strikes a child with a belt, leaving severe bruises. This is an intentional infliction of physical injury and constitutes child abuse. Depending on the severity of the bruising, it could be elevated to Aggravated Child Abuse.',
    url: 'https://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&URL=0800-0899/0827/Sections/0827.03.html'

    title: 'Abuse, Neglect, or Exploitation of an Elderly or Disabled Adult',
    category: 'Crimes Against Persons',
    description: 'Criminalizes the abuse, aggravated abuse, or neglect of an elderly person or disabled adult. It also covers the financial exploitation of these individuals.',
    fullText: '“Abuse of an elderly person or disabled adult” means: (a) Intentional infliction of physical or psychological injury... (b) An intentional act that could reasonably be expected to result in physical or psychological injury... (c) Active encouragement of any person to commit an act that results or could reasonably be expected to result in physical or psychological injury...',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (Felony)',
    practicalSummary: 'Similar to child abuse, this statute provides enhanced protections for vulnerable adults. Your investigation should focus on the victim\'s status as elderly (60+) or disabled, the nature of the abuse (physical, emotional, financial), and the relationship of the suspect (often a caregiver or family member).',
    example: 'A home health aide uses an elderly patient\'s debit card to make unauthorized purchases. This is financial exploitation of an elderly person, a felony under this statute.',

    category: 'Property Crimes',
    description: 'Defines the crime of willfully and maliciously injuring or damaging any real or personal property belonging to another. The severity of the offense is tiered based on the monetary value of the damage caused.',
    fullText: 'A person commits the offense of criminal mischief if he or she willfully and maliciously injures or damages any real or personal property belonging to another. The degree of the offense depends on the amount of the damage.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (by damage amount)',
    practicalSummary: "This is Florida's vandalism statute. Similar to theft, the most important element for your report is establishing the monetary value of the damage. Get repair estimates or receipts for the damaged property. Also, 'maliciously' means the act was done with ill will or hatred, which can be inferred from the circumstances (e.g., spray-painting a rival's car).",
    example: "A suspect intentionally keys the side of a car during a dispute. You obtain a repair estimate from a body shop for $1,200. Because the damage exceeds the $1,000 threshold, the suspect can be charged with felony criminal mischief.",

    title: 'Burglary',
    category: 'Property Crimes',
    description: 'Defines burglary as entering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein, unless the premises are at the time open to the public or the defendant is licensed or invited to enter.',
    fullText: '“Burglary” means: (a) Entering a dwelling, a structure, or a conveyance with the intent to commit an offense therein... (b) Notwithstanding a licensed or invited entry, remaining in a dwelling, structure, or conveyance: 1. Surreptitiously, with the intent to commit an offense therein; 2. After permission to remain has been withdrawn, with the intent to commit an offense therein; or 3. To commit or attempt to commit a forcible felony.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (typically Felony)',
    enhancements: ["Becomes a first-degree felony if the offender commits an assault or battery upon any person, is or becomes armed, or uses a motor vehicle to cause damage.", "Becomes a Life Felony if offender is armed with explosives or a dangerous weapon.", "Severity increases if the dwelling is occupied or if it occurs during a state of emergency."],
    practicalSummary: "The core of burglary is 'intent.' The person enters without permission *with the goal of committing another crime inside* (usually theft). This intent can be inferred from the circumstances, like forced entry or entering at night. Note the 'remaining in' clause: a person who enters legally but then hides to commit a crime later is also guilty of burglary.",
    example: "A suspect breaks a window and climbs into a closed convenience store after midnight. Even if you catch them before they have taken anything, the act of forced entry into a closed business is sufficient evidence to infer they entered 'with the intent to commit an offense therein' (theft), thus completing the crime of burglary.",

    degreeOfCharge: 'Second-degree Misdemeanor',
    enhancements: ["Upgrades to a first-degree misdemeanor if another person is in the structure/conveyance at the time.", "Can be enhanced if a firearm is carried."],
    practicalSummary: 'This is a lesser offense than burglary. The key difference is the lack of "intent to commit an offense therein." This charge is used when someone is in a place they shouldn\'t be, but you cannot prove they intended to commit another crime like theft. It becomes a felony if a human being is in the structure/conveyance at the time.',
    example: 'A homeless person enters an abandoned building to sleep for the night. They have not forced entry and do not intend to steal anything. This would be Trespass, not Burglary.',

    fullText: 'A person who, without being authorized, licensed, or invited, willfully enters upon or remains in any property other than a structure or conveyance...as to which notice against entering or remaining is given...commits the offense of trespass on property other than a structure or conveyance.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'First-degree Misdemeanor',
    practicalSummary: 'This is for trespassing on open land, in a park after hours, or at a business after being asked to leave. The key element is notice. This can be a "No Trespassing" sign or a verbal warning from an owner or law enforcement. Your report must document that the warning was given and the suspect refused to leave.',
    example: 'You are dispatched to a convenience store where a person is loitering and harassing customers. The store manager asks them to leave, and they refuse. You arrive and give them a lawful order to leave the property, and they still refuse. You can now arrest them for Trespass After Warning.',

    description: "Consolidates various historical theft offenses into a single, unified statute. It defines theft as knowingly obtaining or using another's property with the intent to deprive them of it, either permanently or temporarily. The severity of the offense is tiered based on the monetary value of the property stolen.",
    fullText: 'A person commits theft if he or she knowingly obtains or uses, or endeavors to obtain or to use, the property of another with intent to, either temporarily or permanently: (a) Deprive the other person of a right to the property or a benefit from the property. (b) Appropriate the property to his or her own use or to the use of any person not entitled to the use of the property. The degree of the offense depends on the value of the property taken.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (by value)',
    practicalSummary: "This is your go-to statute for nearly all property theft. The most critical part of your investigation is to clearly establish and document the value of the stolen property, as this dictates whether you have a misdemeanor petit theft or a felony grand theft. Be specific about make, model, condition, and get receipts or victim estimates whenever possible.",
    example: "A suspect shoplifts a high-end jacket from a department store. You confirm with the store's loss prevention that the jacket's retail price is $755. Because the value exceeds the $750 threshold, your investigation supports a charge of Grand Theft in the Third Degree under this statute, rather than a misdemeanor petit theft.",

    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (Felony)',
    enhancements: ["Becomes a first-degree felony if the offender carries a firearm or other deadly weapon."],
    practicalSummary: "Robbery is theft by force or threat of force. The key distinction from theft is the 'force, violence, assault, or putting in fear' element. It must happen 'in the course of the taking.' This includes the act of taking itself, as well as the flight immediately after. Robbery is always a felony, and the severity increases if a weapon is carried or used.",
    example: "A suspect snatches a purse from a victim's shoulder. The act of using force to pull the purse away from the victim's resistance elevates the crime from a simple theft to a robbery. If the suspect had simply picked up a purse the victim had left on a bench, it would be theft.",

    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (Felony/Misdemeanor)',
    practicalSummary: "This is Florida's identity theft law. Your investigation needs to show two main things: 1) The suspect possessed or used someone else's personal info (name, DOB, SSN, bank account number, etc.), and 2) They did it with fraudulent intent, meaning for some kind of unlawful purpose or gain. Documenting the financial loss is crucial for determining the degree of the felony.",
    example: "A suspect uses a stolen credit card number to make online purchases. They have willfully and fraudulently used the victim's personal identification information (the credit card number) without consent. The value of the fraudulent purchases will determine the severity of the charge.",

The key elements are that you must be engaged in a 'lawful execution of a legal duty' (e.g., making a lawful arrest) and the suspect must 'offer or do violence.'

    example: "During a consensual encounter, a suspect lifts their shirt to get their wallet, revealing a handgun tucked into their waistband that was not visible before. If they do not have a concealed weapons permit, this constitutes Carrying a Concealed Firearm.",

    title: 'Possession of Firearm by Felon',
    category: 'Weapons Offenses',
    description: 'Makes it unlawful for a person who has been convicted of a felony to own, possess, or have in their care, custody, or control any firearm, ammunition, or electric weapon or device.',
    fullText: 'It is unlawful for any person to own or to have in his or her care, custody, possession, or control any firearm, ammunition, or electric weapon or device...if that person has been...convicted of a felony in the courts of this state or of any other state.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Second-degree Felony',
    practicalSummary: "This is the 'possession of a firearm by a convicted felon' statute. The elements are simple: 1) The suspect has a prior felony conviction, and 2) They were in actual or constructive possession of a firearm. Confirming the felony conviction through a criminal history check is a critical step in your investigation.",
    example: "You stop a vehicle for a traffic violation. The driver is a convicted felon. You see a handgun on the passenger seat. The driver is in constructive possession of the firearm, and because he is a convicted felon, he can be charged under this statute.",

    description: 'Prohibits knowingly discharging a firearm in any public place or on the right-of-way of any paved public road, highway, or street, or over any of these areas.',
    fullText: 'Any person who knowingly discharges a firearm in any public place or on the right-of-way of any paved public road, highway, or street or over any occupied premises is guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree. This section does not apply to persons lawfully defending life or property.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'First-degree Misdemeanor',
    practicalSummary: "This statute is for reckless gun use, like celebratory gunfire. Your investigation should focus on collecting evidence of the discharge (casings, witness testimony) and establishing the location as a public place or roadway. Self-defense is a key exception.",
    example: "Residents report hearing gunshots on New Year's Eve. You find a suspect in their front yard with a handgun and spent shell casings nearby. The suspect admits to 'firing a few rounds into the air to celebrate.' This is a direct violation of this statute.",

    degreeOfCharge: 'Second-degree Misdemeanor',
    practicalSummary: 'Florida is not an open-carry state for firearms. A person cannot have a firearm visible on their person in public. There are exceptions for hunting, fishing, and camping, or while at a firing range. Note that the 2023 "permitless carry" law applies to CONCEALED carry, not open carry.',
    example: 'A person is walking down a public sidewalk with a handgun visibly tucked into their waistband, not covered by a shirt. This is a violation of the open carry statute.',

    description: 'If any person having or carrying any dirk, sword, sword cane, firearm, electric weapon or device, or other weapon shall, in the presence of one or more persons, exhibit the same in a rude, careless, angry, or threatening manner, not in necessary self-defense, the person so offending shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.',
    fullText: 'If any person having or carrying any dirk, sword, sword cane, firearm, electric weapon or device, or other weapon shall, in the presence of one or more persons, exhibit the same in a rude, careless, angry, or threatening manner, not in necessary self-defense, the person so offending shall be guilty of a misdemeanor of the first degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082 or s. 775.083.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'First-degree Misdemeanor',
    practicalSummary: 'This statute makes it illegal to display a weapon or firearm in a rude, careless, angry, or threatening way in front of others, when not acting in necessary self-defense. The key is the manner of exhibition—it must be done in a way that is intimidating or reckless. Simply having a firearm is not a crime; exhibiting it improperly is.',
    example: 'During a heated argument over a parking spot, one driver lifts his shirt to reveal a handgun tucked in his waistband to intimidate the other driver. This act constitutes improper exhibition because the firearm was displayed in a threatening manner, not for self-defense.',

A common example is a "Glock switch" or "auto sear," which converts a semi-automatic pistol into a machine gun. Possession of such a device, even if not installed on a firearm, is a felony.',
    example: 'During a search, you find a small, rectangular device known to be an auto sear for a Glock pistol. The suspect is charged with possession of a machine gun, as the device can "readily" make a firearm operable as one.',

    fullText: 'A person who unnecessarily overloads, overdrives, torments, deprives of necessary sustenance or shelter, or unnecessarily mutilates, or kills any animal...commits a misdemeanor of the first degree... A person who intentionally commits an act to any animal which results in the cruel death, or excessive or repeated infliction of unnecessary pain or suffering...commits a felony of the third degree.',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Varies (Misdemeanor/Felony)',
    practicalSummary: 'Document the condition of the animal and its environment thoroughly with photos. The key distinction for a felony charge is intent and the severity/repetition of the suffering. Coordinate with Animal Control, as they are often the primary investigators and caregivers for the animal victims.',
    example: 'A dog is found tied in a yard with no food or water, severely emaciated. This is misdemeanor animal cruelty. In contrast, a witness sees a person repeatedly and intentionally beating a dog with an object, causing severe injuries; this is felony aggravated animal cruelty.',

    practicalSummary: 'This is the legal foundation for requiring a breath test after a DUI arrest. You must read the Implied Consent warnings verbatim from your agency card or manual. A first refusal results in a 1-year license suspension; a second refusal is a separate criminal misdemeanor.',
    example: 'After making a DUI arrest, you read the suspect the Implied Consent warning. The suspect says, "I\'m not blowing." You document this as a refusal, which carries its own penalties separate from the DUI charge itself.',

(2) A felony has in fact been committed, and the officer has probable cause to believe that the person committed it... (3) The officer has probable cause to believe that a felony has been or is being committed and has probable cause to believe that the person to be arrested has committed or is committing it... (9)(a) The officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed an act of domestic violence...',
    degreeOfCharge: 'Procedural Statute',
    practicalSummary: 'This statute is the basis of your arrest authority. The key takeaway for patrol is the "in the presence" requirement for most misdemeanors. However, you must know the exceptions listed in the statute, such as for domestic violence, retail theft, and carrying a concealed weapon, which allow for a warrantless misdemeanor arrest based on probable cause even if not committed in your presence.',
    example: 'You respond to a domestic disturbance. The suspect is gone, but the victim has visible injuries and gives a credible statement that her boyfriend (who lives with her) caused them. Even though you did not witness the battery, this statute gives you the authority to arrest the boyfriend for misdemeanor domestic battery based on probable cause.',
