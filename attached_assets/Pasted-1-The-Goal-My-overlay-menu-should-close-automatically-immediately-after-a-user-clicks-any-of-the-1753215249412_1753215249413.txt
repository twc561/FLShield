1. The Goal üéØ
My overlay menu should close automatically immediately after a user clicks any of the menu items inside it.

2. The Problem üêû
Describe the exact bug. For example: "When a user clicks a menu item, the associated action (like navigation) happens, but the overlay menu itself remains visible on the screen. It only closes if I click the 'X' button or outside the menu area."

[Describe your specific problem here.]

3. My Technical Environment üõ†Ô∏è

Framework/Library: [e.g., React, Vue, Angular, Svelte, Vanilla JS]

UI Toolkit/CSS: [e.g., Material-UI, Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or Custom CSS/Styled-Components]

State Management: [e.g., React's useState/Context, Redux, Vuex, Pinia, a simple variable]

Relevant Firebase Services: [e.g., Firebase Authentication, Firestore]

4. How the Menu Logic Works ‚öôÔ∏è

State Management: How is the menu's visibility controlled? Describe the state variable (e.g., a boolean state like isMenuOpen).

Opening the Menu: How is the state updated to show the menu? (e.g., "A button in the navbar sets isMenuOpen to true.")

The Failing Logic: What is the intended logic for closing the menu after an item click? Describe how the state is supposed to be updated to hide the menu. (e.g., "Each menu item has an onClick handler that should call a function passed down via props to set isMenuOpen back to false.")

[Describe your implementation logic here.]

5. What I've Already Tried üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Console Checks: What have you confirmed with console.log()? (e.g., "I've confirmed the onClick handler on the menu items is firing.")

Error Messages: Are there any error messages in the browser's developer console when you perform the action? If so, what are they?

State & Props Inspection: Using developer tools (like React DevTools), have you checked if the state-changing function is correctly passed as a prop to the menu component? Does the state variable actually change, even if the menu doesn't disappear?

Event Propagation: Have you checked for any event.stopPropagation() or event.preventDefault() calls that might be interfering with the process?

[List your troubleshooting steps and findings here.]

My Question:
Based on my description, what are the most likely reasons my state-updating logic is failing or not causing a re-render to hide the menu? Please provide specific, actionable steps I can take to debug this further.
