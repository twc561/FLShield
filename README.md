# Firebase Studio

This is a NextJS starter in Firebase Studio.

To get started, take a look at src/app/page.tsx.

## Local Development & Debugging

To run the application locally for development, use the following command:

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Checking for Errors Before Deploying

You can check for common errors locally before deploying your application.

**To run the linter and check for code quality issues:**

```bash
npm run lint
```

**To run a production build and catch deployment errors (like client-side hook issues):**

```bash
npm run build
```# FLShield
